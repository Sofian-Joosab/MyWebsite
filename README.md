# My Website

A website that shows your work, experiences and talks a bit about yourself.

## Getting Started

To start download the files or clone them, you can run these files in a live enviorment or a test enviorment.
After getting the files you can open them in a text editor and see the code.

### Prerequisites

If you are running it in a test enviorment such as wamp or xampp you need to have internet connection as there are links such as font and bootstrap that need to get resources online.
